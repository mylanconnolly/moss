# Moss Design

The architecture narrative behind the locked decisions in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The roadmap says *what* was decided; this document
says *how the pieces work together* and records reasoning detailed enough to
stop relitigation. When this document and the code disagree, one of them has a
bug — fix whichever is wrong, deliberately.

## Kernel model

Moss is a capability-based microkernel. The kernel implements: address spaces,
threads, domains, capability tables, IPC, and interrupt/fault delivery as
messages. Everything else — drivers, filesystems, networking, init, the
multi-node fabric — is userspace reached over channels.

**Objects and authority.** Kernel objects are allocated by the kernel from
per-domain quotas and referenced exclusively through capability tables. There
is no global namespace of anything in the kernel: no PID table visible to
users, no path lookup, no service registry. Discovery is a userspace protocol
conducted over caps that were explicitly granted.

**Handles are generational** (`shared.Handle`: 24-bit slot + 40-bit
generation). Slot reuse bumps the generation, so a stale handle can never
resurrect authority. Raw kernel pointers and densely-reused small integers
never cross the ABI — this is both a security property and a distribution
prerequisite (remote proxies need identity that survives time and space).

**Cap derivation and revocation** are designed so that a userspace proxy is a
first-class participant: any cap can be re-exported through a proxy with the
proxy's own bookkeeping, because interposition and cross-node delegation both
depend on it.

**User address spaces** live in TTBR0 (39-bit low half), one tree per domain,
TLB-tagged with the domain's ASID (retired with `tlbi aside1is` at teardown).
Kernel-only threads run with TTBR0 walks disabled (TCR.EPD0), so stale user
mappings are unreachable outside the owning domain's threads. User mappings
are W^X and non-global; ARMv8.0 has no PAN, so syscalls may read user buffers
through the live TTBR0 mapping after explicit range checks (revisit on
v8.1+). Syscall ABI: x8 = number, x0..x5 args, x0 = result — numbers and
errnos defined in `shared/` like everything else that crosses the boundary.

## Domains

The domain is the unit of spawn, quota, sandboxing, and teardown — the
jail-equivalent. A domain owns threads, address spaces, and cap tables, and
carries budgets: user memory, kernel-object memory, CPU share. Domains form a
tree; a child's budgets come out of its parent's.

Teardown is total and transitive: revoking a domain cap reclaims the entire
subtree — threads, memory, caps, in-flight IPC (peers get death
notifications). Quota accounting returning to zero after teardown is the
correctness check.

**As built (Phase 6):** domains carry a parent pointer; destroy() recurses
over children before the parent, and the reaper finishes children first so
their credits cascade home before the parent's balance is verified. Quota
accounts are hierarchical — a child's account points at its parent's and
every charge walks the chain — so a parent's limit genuinely bounds its
subtree's total consumption, and the budget slice named at sys_spawn
(kobj/user KB packed in x5) is a local cap within that bound. Failed spawns
unwind completely (abortSpawn). Teardown latency is dominated by the
reaper's polling cadence (one 100ms tick per dependency layer), not by
work; the destroy call itself is ~hundreds of microseconds. Event-driven
reaping is a cheap future win if latency ever matters.

A lesson recorded in code: a notification bound to a thread must have its
latched bits checked *inside recv before blocking* — the interrupt-on-signal
path alone loses signals that arrive while the supervisor is busy between
recvs (the classic lost wakeup). Init also refuses to hand out a channel to
an instance it can see is already dead, closing the window where a death is
signaled but not yet processed. And its sibling (found by the Phase 8
benchmark): consumers of a bound notification must drain it with notify_wait
after every interrupted recv, or the latched bits make every future recv
return interrupted.

Two scheduler lessons from the same benchmark: (1) enqueueing a thread onto
another core must *kick* that core (SGI out of wfi; need_resched + a
preempt check on syscall return for the local core) — without it every
cross-core wakeup silently waits for the target's next 100ms tick, which no
functional test notices but which taxes every IPC round-trip ~2500x; and
(2) the resched SGI has to be enabled in each core's redistributor
(GICR_ISENABLER0), or the kicks vanish without any error.

Because a fresh domain holds *nothing*, the empty sandbox is the zero value.
Sandboxing is not a mode; it is the absence of grants.

## IPC

**Message passing is the semantics; shared memory is a transport.** The
contract of a channel is self-contained messages plus explicitly granted
buffer caps — never an implied shared address space. A channel that crosses
the network (via a fabric proxy) is just a slower channel with identical
semantics.

Two transports, one contract:

1. **Sync fast path** — call/reply in registers, for RPC-shaped traffic. As
   built: four message words + one optional cap attachment per message; side
   A serves (recv/reply), side B calls; per-side refcounts close a side when
   its last cap dies. Cap transfer over messages is the buffer-grant
   mechanism — an shm cap granted in a call is how out-of-line data crosses.
2. **Async rings** — io_uring-style shared-memory submission/completion
   rings for bulk and streams, so services don't need a thread per request.
   As built (Phase 8): the ring is pure userspace over existing primitives —
   an shm grant holds the SQ/CQ pair (SPSC, acquire/release indices, defined
   in shared/ and host-tested), notifications are the doorbells, and
   notify_bind lets the server's blocked recv be interrupted by the
   submission bell, so one thread serves both transports. Entries carry the
   same typed message words as channels plus a correlation id — same
   semantics, different transport; the data plane costs no syscalls, only
   the doorbells do. Measured on virtio-blk at queue depth 8: ~6x the
   sync-channel throughput (19.5us vs 123us per 512B read under TCG; 7.9us
   per op under HVF).

**Failure is in the vocabulary.** Channel death is always observable: peers
receive a death notification and in-flight operations complete with a distinct
error. No protocol may assume a shared clock. Faults are messages delivered to
a supervisor-held cap — which is also the debugger interface.

**Typed protocols via comptime.** IPC protocols are Zig types in `shared/`;
marshaling and stubs are generated at comptime. No separate IDL compiler; the
ABI is type-checked from one source of truth that compiles identically for
kernel, userspace, host tests, and MCU leaf nodes.

**The interposition invariant.** Any cap can be silently replaced by a proxy
the holder cannot distinguish. Therefore **no kernel fast path may ever bypass
a channel** — the moment one service gets a kernel shortcut, filtering,
auditing, and virtualization stop being guarantees and become special cases.

## Init and supervision

Two layers. The **root task** receives all boot caps from the kernel and stays
tiny and near-finished: it starts the **init service**, supervises only it,
and retains enough caps to restart it. Init itself is an ordinary, restartable
process with no special kernel status.

Init is three small responsibilities on top of our primitives:

- **Capability wiring.** The sandbox manifest (typed Zig value: budgets + caps
  + restart policy) *is* the unit file. Dependencies are expressed as granted
  channels, never as ordering — the channel is the synchronization point, so
  boot-ordering bugs are unrepresentable.
- **Channel activation.** Init retains server ends and spawns services on
  first message: demand-start by default, boot time = time to first useful
  service.
- **Supervision, OTP-style.** Crash-only services; restart strategies with
  budgets and backoff; escalation on flapping. Restart = domain revoke +
  respawn from manifest, provably leak-free. Dependents observe channel death
  and re-wire through init. Supervisors nest with domains.

**Crash-only policy (in force since Phase 5):** every service must tolerate
being killed at any instant — no cleanup handlers, no shutdown handshakes,
no state that only survives a polite exit. Restart is the recovery path;
there is no graceful-shutdown protocol to get wrong. Clients hold up their
end: an in-flight call completing with peer_dead means the request may or
may not have been processed, so requests should be safe to resend (the
Phase 5 worker demonstrates the idiom: observe peer_dead, re-wire through
init, resend). Init itself and the root task are the only processes with
orderly exits, because they are the ones reporting system outcome.

**As built (Phase 5):** spawn authority is a `spawner` capability exercised
through sys_spawn against the kernel's embedded image table (a filesystem
replaces the table in Phase 9); a spawned domain is controlled through a
`domain_ctl` cap (stat/destroy — destroy is the one revocation). Deaths are
delivered to the spawner's registered death-watch notification, and a
notification bound to a thread (sys_watch_deaths) interrupts that thread's
blocked recv with Errno.interrupted — one thread can serve a channel and
supervise simultaneously, the seL4 bound-notification idea. A kernel reaper
finishes teardown of drained domains and fires the watch. Init keeps the
client end of every service channel it creates and hands out copies on
connect; a service's death closes the channel (init holds no serving-side
cap), so dependents learn of the death exactly the way any peer does.

## Drivers

Userspace, virtio-first. The driver interface is: MMIO-mapping caps,
IRQ-delivery-as-message, and explicit DMA grants shaped like an IOMMU is
present (identity-stubbed under QEMU until the SMMU lands). Drivers run under
manifests like any other process and are as sandboxable as anything else.

**As built (Phase 7):** an `mmio` cap names a physical window (mapped with
device attributes via mmio_map); an `irq` cap names an SPI range, and
irq_bind routes a line to a notification — delivery masks the line (level
sources must not storm) and irq_ack re-enables after the driver services
the device; dma_alloc returns contiguous zeroed pages with a VA and a
device address (== physical, but callers must treat it as opaque so the
SMMU can change the answer later). The virtio-blk driver speaks the modern
(version 2) virtio-mmio interface with a split virtqueue, probes the slots
its window covers, and serves a typed block protocol; bulk data crosses via
a client-granted shm buffer. QEMU note: virtio-mmio devices default to
force-legacy — run with `-global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false` (run-blk
does).

## Distribution: the fabric

**No single system image.** Sprite/MOSIX/OpenSSI-style transparency fails on
physics: latency and partial failure must be legible to software. Moss ships
explicit-but-ergonomic distribution instead: cap delegation across nodes,
remote channels, remote spawn.

Each node runs a userspace **fabric service**: membership, channel proxying,
remote spawn. A unit file, a sandbox manifest, and a remote-spawn request are
the same artifact — the fabric is init at a larger radius, adding placement
and cap proxying. Membership/consensus/discovery live in userspace where they
can iterate without touching the kernel.

MCU-class devices (no MMU) never run the kernel; they run a tiny leaf-node
runtime speaking Moss protocols over serial/USB/network and appear in the pool
as typed channels.

## Security posture

- W^X unconditional, NX everywhere, separate address spaces per domain,
  kernel/user page-table hygiene from the start.
- No ambient authority anywhere; all power arrives via manifests.
- **Side-channel honesty:** capabilities stop architectural leaks, not
  microarchitectural ones. Stance: per-domain address spaces, no cross-domain
  SMT sharing, and seL4-style time partitioning as a later opt-in for
  sensitive domains. We do not claim caps fix Spectre.

## Platform and boot

First target: aarch64 on QEMU `virt` (GICv3, generic timer, PSCI, virtio),
chosen because Hypervisor.framework makes the edit-compile-boot loop
near-native on the Apple Silicon dev machine and the platform has essentially
zero legacy. The HAL boundary is kept honest for a later x86_64 (UEFI-era
only) port.

Boot contract (Phase 0): the bootable artifact is a raw arm64 Image (Linux
boot protocol) objcopy'd from the kernel ELF, which is kept for symbols and
debugging. The 64-byte Image header in `kernel/boot.zig` requests loading at
RAM base + `0x80000` (the link address, `0x40080000`); QEMU honors the
protocol by placing the DTB in RAM (observed at `0x48000000`) and passing its
physical address in `x0`, entering with MMU/caches off. QEMU `virt` provides
*no* DTB for plain ELF loads — that is why the Image header exists. Only core
0 runs at boot (secondaries arrive via PSCI in Phase 2).

The kernel links in the high half (39-bit VAs; TTBR1 space at
`0xffffff8000000000`, direct map virt = phys + that offset — see
`kernel/mem.zig`). The boot assembly parks non-zero cores, clears BSS, builds
one coarse L1 table (1GB blocks; shared by TTBR0-identity and TTBR1 since
both index identically), enables the MMU, and jumps to `kmain` high. `kmain`
then rebuilds TTBR1 from the devicetree's memory map with 4K-granular W^X
over the kernel image and disables TTBR0 walks (TCR.EPD0), dropping the
identity map.

## Zig conventions

- Version pinned in `build.zig.zon`; bumps are deliberate, standalone commits.
- `build.zig` is the entire build: kernel, userspace, images, QEMU targets.
- Kernel code avoids FP/SIMD (enforced by disabled target features): CPACR
  resets with FP trapped and trap handlers won't save vector state.
- All Zig code runs with the MMU on: boot.zig enables it (coarse map) before
  jumping to kmain, so compiled code never touches Device-typed memory where
  unaligned accesses fault. Pre-MMU work is confined to the hand-written,
  aligned assembly in boot.zig — keep it that way, or bring `strict_align`
  back.
- `shared/` may not import kernel or userspace code and may not allocate; it
  must compile for every target including `thumb-freestanding` leaf nodes.
- Kernel code allocates only through the quota-accounted kernel allocator —
  no hidden allocation, no global general-purpose heap.
- Assembly may only call `export`/`callconv(.c)` functions, never a
  Zig-calling-convention function or function pointer: Zig's unspecified
  convention is free to add hidden parameters (and does, in Debug builds —
  an error-trace pointer in x0). The thread trampoline learned this the hard
  way; entry points reached from asm go through C-ABI shims like
  `schedThreadRun`.
